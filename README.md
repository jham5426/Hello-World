# Hello-World
I am learning.

I am 24 and a firefighter / paramedic. 

I have always been interested in coding but never got around to it. 

I am just starting out and can use all the help and direction I can get. 

I want to learn all the things. 

I want to build websites, programs, databases, and operating systems (eventually).

I need direction on what all I need to learn to create my first complete website. 

My first project will be an interactive website for my fire department.
